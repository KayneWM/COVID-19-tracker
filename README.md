# COVID-19-tracker

The COVID-19 tracker is an interactive application that uses the most recent COVID-19 data to regressed produce scatter plots of countries and/or US counties chosen by the user. Single or multplie locations can be plotted on one plot. A sortable table of results is also generated from the same user input containing numerical data of new and cumulative cases and deaths, cases and deaths by population, and deaths per cases. Review of the data can also be performed by categories other than location.

Automated plots are also available in barplot format, showing the Top 10 US counties for new and cumulative cases from the most 
recent data available. Plots of new and cumulative COVID-19 death are also available to plot for these Top 10 counties.
